PURPOSE

This is a website that is an aid for students learning physics.  It could 
potentially be used for other subjects as well.  I am publishing it under the 
GNU General Public License version 3.  I am asking anyone interested to help me 
with this site, as I believe it can be valuable but it could really use strong 
coders to keep it going.


CONCEPT

This site makes use of a directed labelled knowledge graph, where each vertex and 
each edge contains a concept.  No two vertices contain the same concept, ie. each 
vertex defines a new concept.  However, multiple edge can share the same concept.

Often, the vertex concepts will correspond to nouns - eg. body, mass, velocity,
surface, sum, product, integral, interval, etc.  Many edge concepts will correspond to
prepositions - thus, an edge with its two vertices will correspond to phrases such as:

  mass OF body
  interval FROM quantity
  interval TO quantity
  force ON body
  force OF body
  sum OF quantity

The concept in a vertex can correspond to a general concept, like those mentioned above,
or a *specific instantation* of a more general concept.  In the latter case, the vertex
will have an edge with the concept 'IS A' pointing to the general concept it instantiates.
For example:

  force IS A vector
  vector IS A quantity
  'my force' IS A force

Here 'my force' represents a specific force mentioned in a specific problem.

Each concept has an ID, description, synonyms, etc., so multiple concepts can have the same
name and we can still distinguish one from another.

In addition to the special 'IS A' concept which organizes concepts hierarchically, there is 
an 'IN' concept which organizes them into categories.  For example:

  force IN physics
  vector IN mathematics
  geometry IN mathematics

When a student inputs a problem description, they choose one or more categories to place it
in.  A vertex is created for the problem, and it is categorized appropriately.

  'problem 17' IN thermodynamics

The concepts the student adds to the problem description (eg. 'my force') are categorized
within the problem's vertex.

Each general law, such as the law of conservation of energy, is also given its own vertex,
and each concept within its description is 'IN' it.

A general law also has one or more predicates - each predicate also receives a vertex,
and the subgraph of the law that corresponds to the predicate is all marked as 'IN' the predicate.

After a student builds a problem description, using the 'IS A' concept to state what each part of
the problem is ('my body' IS A body, 'my force' IS A force, etc), we then look at all general laws
that exist within the categories the problem belongs to.  We take their predicate subgraphs, and
see if there is an isomorphism from the predicate to the problem.  If so, we apply the law, by taking
all the structure of the law outside that predicate, and appending it to the problem graph, making
sure we don't append vertices that are already there.

We can do this iteratively in order to solve a problem.  Of course, the computer doesn't do this alone,
because the number of ways all possible laws could be applied would lead to combinatorial explosion.
And anyway, we want the student to learn, not just watch.  Instead, the computer can suggest laws
that could be applied at each step, and the student chooses which to apply.  This way they start
to develop a feel for the most efficient ways to solve various problems, and they also start to 
recognize the predicate patterns on their own because they are displayed explicitly on the screen.



Although the graph representation is the core and should always remain accessible, we can build
additional interfaces that make building and solving a problem more intuitive.  Each concept record
can store rules for visualizing it as a picture, for example, using primitive shapes and relationships
that the computer understands.  This would provide a more intuitive drag-and-drop experience.
