<span class="section-title">Baryon Charge</span>

A hadron contains multiple point particles (quarks), but they are fundamentally inseparable.  In our model, that suggests there are multiple singularities.  In the electron, the loop connects one half-space of the singularity to the other.  In the hadron, a similar structure can connect a half-space of one quark to a half-space of the other.
<p>

	Consider the baryons, each with three quarks.  Each half-space must connect to another, for the manifold to be complete.  Such that the quark half-spaces connect in a cyclic manner.  We can thus refer to the half-space connecting structures as “loop segments”, since only together do they form a full loop.

We can say that each quark has an axis: the line orthogonal to the plane dividing its half-spaces.  And in principle, the configuration of the quarks’ positions and axes is arbitrary.  But we already know there are only a few stable baryons, so let’s consider a simple configuration.  Place the quarks at the vertices of an equilateral triangle, and orient their axes tangent to the circle that circumscribes the triangle.  Then there are four ways of interconnecting their half-spaces:

Why have the quarks been labeled this way?  In the belt, twist is not only associated with a full loop.  If you try to turn the belt in its own plane, that is, turn it about an axis perpendicular to its surface, you cannot do it without stretching or wrinkling the material.  The closest you can do is to twist it about its axis, and then it will naturally turn by the same amount.
<p>

	So, because each colored loop segment only executes a partial loop, its twist, and hence charge, is less than that of the electron.
<p>

	But while we can talk about the charge of a segment, and the two segments connected to a given quark may have different charges, the curvature field around that quark outside the loop should still be continuous as well.  So the external field of the quark should look as though it has a single charge.  Then how is the charge of each segment divided between its two quarks?
<p>

	If the quark axes were aligned, there would be no turn, and the segment would be the straight black edge in the picture.  So if anything, the charge of a quark should be based on how much its axis is turned relative to that straight segment, since that is how much it contributes to the net turn of the segment.
<p>

	Applying that principle to the diagram, we find that the net turn of the “up” quarks is 240 degrees, and the “down” quarks turn 120 degrees.  Since the electron is a full loop, an up quark will have a charge magnitude of \(\frac23 e\), and a down quark \(\frac13 e\).  Also, in the mixed up/down baryons, traversing the whole loop reveals that the sense of the up and down quarks are opposite, so their charges will be as well.

<div class="figure-caption">
    If we consider the net turn a quark induces in its segments based on the orientation of its axis, the up quark has a turn of 240 degrees (yellow curve), \(\frac23\) that of the electron.  The down quark, in contrast, induces only a 120 degree turn (purple curve), \(\frac13\) of the electron.  As you traverse the loop, the sense of rotation at the down quark is opposite that of the up quark, giving them opposite charge signs.  The partial blue segment between the purple and yellow curves has a net turn of zero, so it is not relevant to net charge.

<span class="side-note">A Note on Bosons</span>

The baryonic structure does not appear to require any singularities other than the quarks themselves.  The wave equation dictates that a curvature disturbance propagate at the speed of light, which both gluons and photons supposedly do.  Presumably, electrons and baryons can only be at rest because their curvature wave is inherently confined by their singularity; it still contains local speed of light propagation, but in an orbital rather than linear fashion, conceptually like a black hole (this will be discussed further in <a href="{{=URL('spacetime', 'index', vars={'section': 'external_spin'})}}">External Spin</a>).  So it would make the most sense if gluons are non-singular waves that propagate along the loop segments, and photons are non-singular waves that propagate through external space.  The massive bosons, however, may have a singularity, and this will be discussed later in the context of the <a href="{{=URL('spacetime','index',vars={'section':'higgs_field'})}}">Higgs field</a>.
<p>

	Being composed of the electromagnetic field, the photon ought to have a generally twisting Ricci field.  Also, when absorbed by an atom, it increases the frequency of the electron by its own.  So maybe the process of absorption is generally similar to the superposition of electric fields: the photon adds its own twist of space to that of the atom as it passes through, so that, relative to the outside, the atom is oscillating with the sum of the two frequencies.  Roughly speaking, if that new state is stable it will persist; otherwise the two waves will decouple and go their own ways.
<p>

	Beyond that, the nature of the massless bosons, as well as atoms, will not be pursued further in this paper.
