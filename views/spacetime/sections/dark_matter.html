If dark energy is one kind of large-scale curvature wave, dark matter could be another.  One possibility is that it is a region that is still isotropic, but where the sign of the Ricci tensor has been flipped, such that the time curvature is positive, inducing gravitation rather than accelerated expansion.

	Why should this occur?  If dark matter typically exists in the neighborhood of baryonic matter, this suggests the dark matter wave is induced by the particulate matter.  We know that the latter inherently has positive time curvature, and by virtue of its structure this cannot be otherwise; whereas the vacuum, being unbound, has nothing to prevent it from reversing its signature locally.  So itâ€™s plausible that the whole region containing a galaxy naturally tends toward positive time curvature according to the wave equation.  In this way, dark matter would soften the transition from baryonic curvature to the vacuum curvature, stabilizing the overall galactic waveform.
