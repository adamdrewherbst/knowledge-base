How does the angular momentum manifest outside the singularity?  It should, by continuity.  How can an infinite, continuous field (the curvature) rotate smoothly about a given axis in a periodic way?  It should be periodic, in order for the particle to retain its form over time.  That means the field should not shear, and yet it also should not be rigid, because then at large radii it would propagate faster than light, which appears to violate the wave equation, if not special relativity.

	This question has been answered by Batty-Pratt and Racey {{cite('battypratt_racey',True)}}.  An animation by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw5aOpkU7_uuL73-kVxdJIA">Jason Hise</a> makes it much easier to visualize (in fact he has made a few variations, but this one is the easiest to start with):

        Animation by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw5aOpkU7_uuL73-kVxdJIA">Jason Hise</a>.  In the animation, the notion of spheres is replaced by radial belts; but we can perceive the motion of spheres by noting that each short (infinitesimal) segment of a belt follows the motion of the sphere it lies on.  Here, the spin axis is the vertical.  In the first frame, the horizontal "twist axis" lies along the twisted belt; in succeeding frames, the twist axis rotates about the spin axis.

Batty-Pratt and Racey call it “spherical rotation”.  We start with a reference “unspinning” field, the spin axis, and a “twist axis” perpendicular to it.  Then we rotate each spherical shell of the field about the twist axis by an amount that varies radially, from zero at infinity to 180 degrees at the center.  Finally, we let the twist axis rotate about the spin axis with a certain frequency.  At every instant, in other words, the field is the same transformation of the unspinning field, but applied about a different twist axis.
<p>
	The result is that, at large radii, the field is barely moving at all, and as we approach the center, the motion becomes much more pronounced.  At the center, the 180 degree rotation has the curious effect that the field rotates at twice the precession frequency.
<p>

	So the curvature outside the singularity could propagate in this manner about the loop axis.  The spin inside the loop could have a qualitatively similar form.  Specifically, if our spacetime is stationary, we can associate a particular curvature value with an infinitesimal belt element: that curvature value then propagates along essentially the same path as the belt element does in the animation.  Of course, it remains to be seen whether this pattern of propagation could satisfy the wave equation.

<span class="side-note">A Connection to Quantum Mechanics</span>

Batty-Pratt and Racey go on to demonstrate that, due to the frequency doubling at the core, if we construct a wave function by giving it a different phase for each state the field can be in, and making it homogeneous in the particle’s rest frame, the wave function obeys the Dirac equation.  In other words, this helps us begin to identify the correspondence with quantum mechanics.
<p>

	The point is that this model identifies a free particle as a localized waveform.  Now we are adding the assertion that it also fluctuates with a single, well-defined frequency.  Whereas in quantum mechanics, for a free particle to have a single frequency, it must be completely delocalized.  That is because, from its inception, quantum mechanics assumed a linear wave equation, for which a single-frequency solution is a plane wave, spread evenly throughout all space.  Of course, quantum mechanics resolves the question of localization in two ways: first, by allowing a single free particle to be a sum of multiple frequency components, so that, if the frequency distribution is itself continuous, the waveform can be properly localized into a wave packet; and second, by introducing interaction terms into the wave equation, allowing the single-frequency waves themselves to be modified and thus distinguishing the behavior of free and bound particles.
<p>

	But if we start from the inherently nonlinear curvature wave equation, it allows the possibility of a bound wave with a single frequency, and it incorporates external interactions automatically because these are part of the curvature as well.
<p>

	So it seems there is a kind of duality between this theory and quantum mechanics.  In the case of free particles, that which is completely localized in one case is completely delocalized in the other.  In the case of a bound particle, such as an electron in an atom, the curvature theory, if correct, should give the same general size of the waveform as quantum mechanics, since atomic dimensions have been empirically verified.  But consider the shape: the $s$ orbital is spherical, yet has no orbital angular momentum, so the electron should not be moving in a shape resembling a sphere or circle; whereas the $p$ orbital is axial, yet it does have orbital momentum, so the electron will not be moving back and forth along that axis; more likely it would be orbiting around it.  In other words, if there is a true point-like electron orbiting the nucleus, as there could be in the curvature theory, then the quantum mechanical orbital doesn't seem to correspond to the actual localization of the electron, but rather to its dual in some sense.
<p>

	Perhaps this notion could help explain the success of quantum theory; if it is somehow the “dual of reality”, it would still be a valid representation in typical circumstances, where the nonlinearity of external influences themselves is not too great.
