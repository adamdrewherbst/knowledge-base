Since at least as far back as Riemann {{cite('riemann_hypotheses',True)}}, some mathematicians and physicists have suggested that matter could ultimately be modeled as curvature of space or distortion of some continuous ether which pervades it.  Once general relativity made it clear that spacetime was not constrained to a single form, but could take on an infinity of possible forms according to its curvature, Einstein and contemporaries pursued this line of inquiry, but information about the fundamental particles was lacking at the time.  Many authors have drawn parallels between the fundamental particles and geometric structures, and theories have been developed on this basis, to varying degrees; recent examples include {{cite('only_spacetime')}}, {{cite('torus_knots')}}, {{cite('knot_physics')}}, and {{cite('spin_charge_topological')}}.  The attraction is the simplicity inherent in a theory where, in the deepest possible mathematical sense, there is only one entity.  This paper attempts to develop these ideas a little further.
