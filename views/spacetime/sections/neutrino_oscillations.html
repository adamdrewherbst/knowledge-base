<span class="section-title">Neutrino Oscillations</span>

For the two-loop electron neutrino to become the four-loop muon neutrino, it must sprout two extra loops.  The loops of a given particle form a sequence, in that a geodesic flows first through one, then through another.  So the two new loops could either be appended (a) both to the end of the sequence, or (b) one to the beginning and the other to the end.  Itâ€™s not clear whether one of these two would be preferred or required (for example, maybe the creation of a new loop must occur adjacent to an existing one, in which case the two new loops would have to form at opposite ends).  In any case, by continuity, the new loops must increase their length gradually from zero.  As they grow, shrink, and disappear, the neutrino changes its flavor.

	The charged leptons, of course, cannot undergo this transformation because their masses are so different.  The energy difference could only be recruited from the vacuum, but, in accordance with the description of the weak force above, this would not happen without an extreme inhomogeneity such as a Higgs boson.  Also note that, for the sign of a charged lepton to remain the same, the pair of new loops would have to be appended to the same end, so that their senses are opposite to each other.  But the issue of mass already prohibits their oscillations.
