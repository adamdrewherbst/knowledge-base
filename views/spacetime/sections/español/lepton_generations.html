<span class="section-title">Lepton Generations</span>

If quark generations are based on additional loops, could the same be true of leptons?  An electron is already a single loop.  If we add a countersense loop, the net charge is now zero.  If this is an elementary particle, and it is so closely related to the electron, the most natural candidate is the electron neutrino.

	When we add a third loop, the charge is restored to that of the electron, so this would be the muon.  And so, by successive addition of loops, we form the muon neutrino, then the tauon, and finally the tau neutrino.

As with the quarks, this pattern ought to continue in theory.  That poses a well-known concern, because according to the mass trend, the next particle after the tauon should be easily accessible to current accelerator energies.  It is not clear why it would not have been observed to date.
