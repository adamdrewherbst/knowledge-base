Thus charge may be based on the looping of space, and it is quantized because, for the manifold to be complete, there can be no partial loops.  The charge of one loop is the elementary charge, and it manifests to us as a compensating twist of space.
<p>

	Spin is also quantized.  The concept of spin is a rotation of mass over time; alternatively, we can think of it as a twisting of matter about the time direction, in a given spatial plane (see figure below).  So in this model, spin could arise from the looping of timelike geodesics, with Planck’s constant the associated topological invariant.

Until now we had only considered the curvature in the 3-space of the particle’s rest frame.  But by continuity, it would make most sense if all directions of spacetime participate in the singularity and the loop structure.  And as long as we are considering time evolution, it would also be most natural if there is a singularity at each instant, together forming the worldline.
<p>

	That means a geodesic that enters the singularity at one instant, may exit at another; we can call that time difference the period of the geodesic. The spatial geodesics might have zero period, with the period increasing as the direction approaches time, though it wouldn’t have to be this way.
<p>

	A schematic representation could be like this:
<p>


<div id="fig:electron_time_loop" class="figure">
<image src="{{=URL('static','spacetime/images/Electron_Time_Loop.jpg')}}"></image>
<div class="figure-caption">
    A timelike geodesic (blue) traversing the spatial cross-sections (red) of the electron
</div>
</div>

Here the red loops are the spatial cross sections, and the blue curve is a timelike geodesic, with the green dots showing their intersections.  If the Ricci curvature along time is also negative at the singularity, then all directions of spacetime will be momentarily parallel, ie. it will be a “neck pinch” of all spacetime.  In other words, the blue geodesic is actually parallel to both the worldline and the red loop where they meet, though this cannot be drawn on flat paper.
<p>

	The neutrino would then look like this:
<p>


<div id="fig:neutrino_time_loop" class="figure">
<image src="{{=URL('static','spacetime/images/Neutrino_Time_Loop.jpg')}}"></image>
<div class="figure-caption">

</div>
</div>

This picture may suggest conceptually why the neutrino has the same spin (“time charge”) as the electron despite having zero electric (“spatial”) charge.  Each of the two spatial loops is a full 360 degree turn, so that if we follow for instance a +z geodesic along the loop, it ends in the +z direction.  But imagine following the blue time geodesic from its upper right endpoint in the diagram.  It is initially moving forward in time; after it passes through the singularity, it moves uniformly backward in time as it traverses the two spatial loops.  Only when it exits through the left-most singularity does it move forward again.  So apparently, time only executes a single loop in any elementary fermion, thus giving them all the same topologically invariant spin.
<p>

	As we move along a radial geodesic, the curvature twists in the tangential plane.  Because the wave equation ensures that the spatial variation of curvature matches the time variation, the twist over time should occur in that same plane.  Therefore, the spatial axis about which mass rotates (the spin axis) should be the same as the axis of the spatial loop.
