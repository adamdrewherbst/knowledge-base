Here it was argued that particles may be spacetime solitons.  They do contain singularities, but the singularity is of a nature that does not render the manifold discontinuous, in spite of its infinite local curvature.  They correctly manifest as point particles whose electric field has an inverse relationship with radial distance.  Their charge and spin are topological invariants.  And they can potentially be solutions of a simple law governing the manifold, most likely the curvature wave equation.

	Perhaps the most important point mathematically is that the law should ease the constraints imposed by general relativity, by restricting only the variation of the curvature tensor, rather than demanding that the curvature itself, in the form of the Einstein tensor, correspond to entities that are perceptibly following geodesic paths.  This allows new kinds of structures, on scales both microscopic and cosmic, that may correspond to phenomena currently without a unified explanation.

	Nothing has been proven here, and even if the general idea is workable, it is likely there are elements suggested in the preceding sections that would have to be replaced.  Lacking is a convincing explanation why we have only observed three generations, and there is no apparent connection to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koide_formula">Koide formula</a>, although the general idea of mass increase corresponds well to the distribution of twist over multiple loops.  But the overall notion of loops with their topologically compensating electric twist, and the way this naturally leads to the composition of the baryons, is very encouraging.
<p>

	The only way to convincingly validate a theory of this kind would be to derive from it the attributes of the fundamental particles currently considered purely empirical.  But before that could be done, one would have to determine exactly how the analogy of the belt carries over to a three- or four-dimensional manifold, so as to quantify the initial curvature field of a charged particle to which the wave equation must apply.  That is, the twisting Ricci field appears to be a purely topological result, independent of the law that governs its evolution.  In order to work this out, we might have to discover the continuous process by which an electron could be created from a non-singular manifold.
<p>

	Once that is done, one might try to build a computer simulation of the electron, from which its mass could be immediately extracted.  The asymptotic boundary condition to the wave equation would be the known value of the isotropic, homogeneous Ricci curvature in the vacuum (dark energy).  The issue of course is the singularity.  On the one hand, the metric of a general neck pinch singularity may remain well-behaved.  But in this case, we also have the twisting curvature field, and the rate of twist itself should diverge at the singularity.  So we would somehow have to capture this infinite variation in a discrete representation.  This would probably involve some simplifying assumptions about the how the region near the singularity behaves relative to its surroundings, so that it would not have to be modeled in its entirety.
<p>

	Of course, nothing precludes an analytical solution corresponding to a particle, though the wave equation, besides being nonlinear, involves such high-order derivatives of the metric as to make this a difficult task.
