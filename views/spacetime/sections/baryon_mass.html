<span class="section-title">Baryon Mass</span>

In the discussion of baryon spin states, we saw that two of the spin vectors have to be aligned with respect to the loop, though these can be anti-aligned with the third.  And the explanation for the coupling of opposite spins was that aligned spins will have higher curvature due to the addition of their angular momenta.  So the loop segment connecting the aligned spins will have high curvature.  And since mass is the volume integral of curvature, there will be significant mass in that segment.  That could be the source of the high intrinsic mass of the baryons.

	Note also that, in the spin-½ states, the two aligned quarks are the ones with the same charge.  If anything, that would tend to increase their distance from one another, thus increasing the volume of their loop segment, making the mass larger still.

	Experiments have shown that the delta baryons have masses around 1232 MeV, while the nucleons are about 938 MeV.  The common difference in the loop model is that one of the spin vectors is reversed externally, so that we don’t have the “vortex ring” configuration.  If this only increases the mass by about one-third of its initial value, that supports the idea that most of the nucleon mass is in the spin-aligned loop segment.  And that would imply that if we did align all vectors with respect to the loop, the mass would probably triple, or nearly so.  That could explain why those states are never observed.  On the other hand, the fact that one vector is anti-aligned could also be an inherent result of the process that creates baryons.
