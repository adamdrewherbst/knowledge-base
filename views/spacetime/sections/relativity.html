Because a path in the surface is made up of infinitesimal vectors, and the length of a vector is expressed by a dot product, we ended up with the quadratic form of the metric, of which we have to take the square root to find an actual distance.

$$\lvert d\vec r \rvert^2 = (\hat x \, dx + \hat y \, dy) \cdot (\hat x \, dx + \hat y \, dy)
 = (\hat x \cdot \hat x) dx^2 + 2(\hat x \cdot \hat y) dx \, dy + (\hat y \cdot \hat y) dy^2$$
$$ := g_{xx} \, dx^2 + 2 g_{xy} \, dx \, dy + g_{yy} dy^2$$

Of course, in a real surface, \(\lvert d\vec r \rvert^2\) has to be positive.  We <i>derive</i> the metrics of known surfaces so as to calculate their properties, and the fact that they were real surfaces to begin with ensures the metric will always be positive.
<p>
But the quadratic form of the metric admits negative values.  In particular, if the determinant of the metric,

$$ g_{xx} \, g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2 $$

is negative, then the metric <i>will</i> have negative values.  We can see this by considering a "level curve" of the metric: coordinates of points that are all the same metric value from a given point \(p\), ie. they are "equal distance from the center".  (Since the metric is
only a first-order approximation, these coordinates must be infinitesimal.)  If the determinant is positive, then these level curves will be ellipses.  But if it is negative, they will be hyperbolas.

And in the hyperbolic case, the two color-coded families have opposite signs of "\(\lvert d\vec r \rvert^2\)".
<p>
The elliptic case is the one that occurs on real surfaces.  On a real surface, the metric represents distance; that's why Riemann formulated it in the first place.  And in the infinitesimal limit on a surface, the set of paths with the same distance from a point \(p\) is a true circle.  It's just that it can <i>map</i> to an eccentric ellipse in coordinate space if our axes are not perpendicular, and/or they have different scale factors.

The same thing happens in the 3D space around us.  If we label it with an \(xyz\) coordinate system, then consider infinitesimal paths of equal distance from a point \(p\) in just the \(xy\) plane, they still form circles and ellipses in coordinate space.  In fact, we might think that if we
used the right coordinate system - the Cartesian one - we could extend these paths indefinitely and they would still form proportional coordinate ellipses if they have equal distance from \(p\).  But by finding that the math of curved surfaces extends to three dimensions, Riemann showed that,
if space is curved, no such coordinate system actually exists.
<p>
So what about the hyperbolic case?  It could just be a mathematical curiosity.
<p>
Of course, Einstein showed otherwise, through the two enormous paradigm shifts of special and general relativity.  But from the comfort of hindsight, we can speculate
that the better part of that transition could have been achieved more simply, in light of Riemann's work.
<p>
One could have arrived at relativity by postulating only that spacetime <i>is</i> a continuum.  Because we already know from experience that space is Riemannian, ie. the coordinates of equal-metric curves form ellipses at <i>least</i> for
small measurements, if not large ones.  So even if time is to be incorporated as a fourth dimension, the whole should still be Riemannian.  A point thus specifies both a location and instant, and paths include not only
spatial paths, but trajectories.  The former are called "spacelike", the latter "timelike".  And since measurements of these paths can be either distances or times, we simply call them "intervals".
<p>
We already know by what type of metric the dimensions of space relate to each other: elliptic.
So we are only left to find how space and time intervals relate.  But if they were also elliptic, time would be mathematically equivalent to a fourth dimension of space, so we should not perceive
it as a different kind of quantity.
<p>
So really, the spacetime metric must be hyperbolic.  We have only to check that we can make it work.  As in the spatial case, our coordinates represent infinitesimal measurements relative to some point \(p\), but now we
are measuring time intervals along with distances.  We are claiming that sets of infinitesimal paths of "equal interval" from \(p\) are measured as hyperbolas.
<p>
The most natural set of measurements we can use are those made by a single observer; call them \(A\).  So when we plot \(A\)'s measurements, we should end up with the most natural form of the hyperbola: the vertices
intersect the space and time axes.

<div class="figure">
<image width=50% src="{{=URL('static','spacetime/images/motivation/rest_frame_axes.png')}}"></image>
<div class="figure-caption">
    \(A\)'s trajectory (\(dt\) axis) and the paths \(A\) perceives as space (red lines), on the map of \(A\)'s own measurements.  The reference point \(p\) is at the origin.
</div>
</div>

\(A\)'s time axis is also their trajectory, because they don't measure their self to have moved.  Also, we can see that \(A\)'s space axes are tangent to the time hyperbolas.
<p>
The trajectories of any other observer \(B\) who passed through point \(p\) must lie on this map too.  We could change our axes to represent \(B\)'s measurements instead.  Then the trajectory of \(B\) would pass
through the vertex of the hyperbola, and their space axis would be tangent to it.  But a change of coordinates does not alter whether two real curves intersect or are tangent; and remember that the hyperbola represents the same real
curve for both observers: a set of points a certain "interval" from \(p\).  Thus, \(B\)'s trajectory and space axis must intersect and be tangent to that hyperbola according to \(A\)'s measurements as well.

<div class="figure">

<div class="figure-caption">
    \(B\)'s trajectory (black line) and the paths \(B\) perceives as space (orange lines), again on the map of \(A\)'s measurements
</div>
</div>

To completely specify the nature of small measurements, we just need one more observation: that in order for the continuum to be perceived the same way by all observers, the space/time
slope of the hyperbola's asymptote should be invariant.  Of course, we call that slope the speed of light.
<p>
But these are just the laws of relativity.  So relativity is really the <i>only</i> reasonable way for spacetime to be a continuum at all.
<p>
The question is, why would anyone postulate that the mathematical form of space and time is a single continuum?  But then, why would anyone postulate anything else?  Newton devoted
much of the <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Mathematical_Principles_of_Natural_Philosophy_(1846)/Definitions">"Scholium" section of the Principia</a> to explicitly defining absolute
space and time; yet there was little justification to offer for it.  Newtonian space is infinite and Euclidean, and there is a distinct instance of it for each instant of time, making spacetime
fundamentally a Cartesian product of a three-dimensional space and a one-dimensional time.  Newton had to choose his model from among the mathematical structures that were known at the time.
<p>
But what if the great integration of mathematics and physics, embodied by the Principia, had occurred after the development of intrinsic differential geometry?  Euclidean space is only a special case of a Riemannian
manifold, that has the additional restrictions imposed by Euclid's postulates.  So the wiser assertion would have been only that space is Riemannian, because that
implies fewer assumptions, allowing more room for the theory to be right.
<p>
And because the hyperbolic metric pops up naturally in intrinsic geometry -- to be excluded, it must be explicitly asserted that metric gives only positive values -- it might have been considered,
and found to be a means of relating spatial and temporal measurements, without having to postulate time as an additional entity.  In other words, Occam's razor might have led naturally to the relativistic
model of spacetime in the first place.  Then, the existence of an invariant maximum speed would have been a novel prediction of the theory, to be borne out later when the theories of electromagnetic and/or
gravitational waves were developed and confirmed.  Who knows -- if Riemann hadn't died at 39, maybe he would have explored this avenue himself.
<p>
But how did that transition unfold historically?  First, Einstein found the hyperbolic metric of special relativity in order to <i>explain</i> the invariant speed that had already been uncovered by
electromagnetism.  But for the time being, the Euclidean postulates were left in place.  However, even at this step the model of spacetime became simpler insofar as it postulated only
one entity, with one metric, instead of two.
<p>
Because special relativity provided a single metric for any path in spacetime, the trajectories of bodies could be compared according to their "interval" (which is also the time measured by an observer on that trajectory).
And not surprisingly, it was found that the "inertial" trajectories -- the family of paths that all maintain constant velocities relative to one another, hence the trajectories
that will be followed by unforced bodies -- were also the mathematically distinguished paths according to their interval.  (Specifically, they were the paths of <i>maximum</i> interval between any two points, which may seem
opposite of what one would guess, but it's just a result of the hyperbolic nature of the metric.)  That is, they are the generalizations of straight lines.  This result was first found by
Planck, as noted <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1355219813000695">in this article</a>.
<p>
The next inconsistency that became apparent was that between special relativity and gravitation.  And it was only in the attempt to reconcile these that Einstein had his "happiest thought", which, in streamlined form, can
be stated as follows: the <i>local</i> experience of
an observer in gravitational free fall, is no different than the <i>local</i> experience of an observer drifting inertially,
free of all forces.  In either case, all bodies in the vicinity experience the same gravitational acceleration -- finite in the first case, zero in the second -- so they only perceive each other as accelerating to the extent
that they interact.  Only from a distance do the inertially moving and free-falling observers perceive themselves as accelerating toward or away from each other.

<div class="figure">
<image width=50% src="{{=URL('static','spacetime/images/motivation/gravitational_paths.jpg')}}"></image>
<div class="figure-caption">
    Space-time trajectories of the Earth (green) and three observers: two in free fall, and one moving inertially, so far from the Earth as not to be deflected.
    Due to the Earth, these trajectories accelerate relative to each other, but each observer perceives no acceleration of objects in their immediate vicinity.
</div>
</div>

So, if the laws of physics were local in character, perhaps the same law could describe both types of motion.  But inertial trajectories were already known to be the maximal-interval ones according to the metric of spacetime:
the "straight lines".  And the only type of structure in which "straight lines" can have relative acceleration, is a <i>curved</i> one.  In this case the term is "geodesics" rather than lines, but they are still the maximal
(shortest or longest) paths between two points.

Thus Einstein, with the help of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Grossmann">Marcel Grossmann</a>, became aware that the Euclidean postulates needed to be let go to allow spacetime to curve, leaving even fewer assumptions than
before.  The gravitational law of motion then became: free-falling bodies follow geodesics in a <i>curved</i> Riemannian manifold.
<p>
Of course, that meant the the curvature should correspond to the gravitational field, hence mass must induce curvature in its vicinity.  This led to the race between Einstein and Hilbert for the field equation to describe how the presence
of mass and energy induces curvature in the first place.  And this is where physical insight led to a rather profound mathematical discovery.  Einstein was guided by the <i>physical</i> knowledge that energy and momentum should be conserved,
and this meant that whatever curvature it corresponds to should have zero divergence.  And he found just such a form of curvature; in fact, the form of curvature he discovered turned out to have <i>identically</i> zero divergence
at <i>every</i> point in <i>any</i> Riemannian manifold.  The Einstein field equation merely says that this form of curvature, called the "Einstein curvature tensor", is the one induced by energy/momentum.
<p>
So now there were two equations.  The field equation determined the curvature of the manifold completely, given a matter distribution that obeys conservation of energy/momentum.  But
this <i>in no way restricts the possible form of the manifold</i>.  Because the non-divergence of the Einstein tensor is a <i>mathematical</i> identity, we can pick <i>any</i> 4D manifold with hyperbolic metric, calculate its Einstein curvature
tensor at each point, declare that the values we find are the energy and momentum of a hypothetical matter distribution, and rest assured that the energy/momentum of the matter is conserved.
<p>
The only question, given that the matter is conserved, is how it flows.  And this is specified by the geodesic equation.
<p>
But at this point, there is nothing to prevent us from <i>identifying</i> the Einstein curvature with the matter that allegedly induces it.  We can equally well say that <i>matter</i> flows along geodesics, or that
<i>curvature</i> flows along geodesics.  Mathematically, the notion of matter becomes merely a middle man, a conceptual crutch, whereas all we really have to do is restrict the <i>manifold</i> by
the geodesic equation, then extract its curvature, and we will find a "matter distribution" that is not only conserved, but moves in the familiar manner of gravitating mass.
<p>
Thus we see that, from the point of view of the manifold, the geodesic equation is the only true restriction: it answers the question, "How does the (inherently conserved) Einstein curvature flow?"
<p>
It is only because matter does <i>not</i> only move gravitationally that we need to retain it as a theoretical entity.  Thus we can allow additional properties of bodies, such as charge, and the interactions of
these extra properties can explain why a body, and its associated Einstein curvature, deviates from its geodesic path.
<p>
Now, as we have seen, the postulate of geodesic motion was, in essence, the epiphany that led to general relativity.  It was the impetus to allow spacetime to curve in the first place.  In accepted physical theories, curved spacetime
has never existed <i>without</i> the restriction of the geodesic equation.  But as we have also seen, <i>a curved manifold in and of itself is already remarkably similar to the world we live in</i>.  If, as we have imagined,
curved manifolds with hyperbolic metric had been considered directly from analysis of Riemannian geometry, they might well have seemed like a compelling choice for a model of spacetime.  And, if the Einstein tensor with its
inherent property of conservation had been stumbled upon, surely it would have appeared striking in its resemblance to the matter that surrounds us.
<p>
Surely, if there is a pure mathematical entity whose inherent patterns so closely parallel those of nature, and which, by its degrees of freedom, can take such an infinity of forms on scales both
large and small, we should ask if all the forms we see in nature are in fact among those infinite possibilities, and all their motions are due to some principle as yet unknown.
<p>
History aside, the point is that, magnificently elegant though it may be as a law of gravity, we are free to let go of the geodesic equation, and contemplate unrestricted Riemannian
spacetime in its own right.  We know it will in general contain "matter", so the question again is how the matter flows, in other words, what law restricts the manifold?  And since geodesic
motion must still be observed on macroscopic scales, the difference should be most noticeable in the microscopic realm.
<p>
But, having come up into the open air of unfettered spacetime, we can start simply by playing, attempting to sculpt the manifold in new and interesting ways, and see if we can find
any that loosely mimic the particles and phenomena that were not explained by gravity.  In particular, there is <i>a priori</i> no reason to suppose that gravitation should be more amenable than any other
phenomenon to a description in terms of spacetime curvature.  Nor is there reason to suppose that it can better describe macroscopic than microscopic phenomena.
<p>
Along the way, we can try to identify the law or laws that all those patterns of curvature adhere to.
<p>
That was apparently the spirit of the unification program pursued by Einstein himself and a number of other physicists over the years, and it is adopted here as well.
