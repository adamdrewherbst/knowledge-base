<span class="section-title">The Generational Mass Trend</span>

Because the wave equation equates spatial and temporal variation, both the plane in which the twist occurs, and the local rate of twist, should generally be the same along the loop axis as they are over time (in geometrized units).  The temporal twist rate determines the spin frequency, which we have taken to be the one that is proportional to mass.  Thus the spatial twist rate may be largely responsible for the mass of the particle.
<p>

	The neutrino has no net spatial twist.  On that basis, its temporal twist rate and mass should be zero.  On the other hand, if it has a true loop structure, the loop has to close at some point, providing a finite mass, but that period will be drawn out as long as possible.  It’s not clear how that would work out; maybe the spatial loops are forced to assume a small amount of twist to compensate, but the two loops assume opposite twists that don’t produce a net external field.  In any case the mass should be very small compared to the electron.
<p>

	The muon has three loops of alternating sense, so it has the same charge as the electron.  We have said that the “total twist” that compensates the loop should be a topological invariant, and that it generally manifests as the anisotropic tangential Ricci field, but it’s not clear exactly how the two relate.  But this invariant ought to be calculable as some kind of integral relating to the curvature.  For our purposes, we don’t need an exact formula.  We just need to suppose that the integral converges, that is, the invariant itself is finite.  In that case, since curvature itself decays monotonically, the rate of “total twist” with radial distance should as well.  It should look qualitatively like a decaying exponential outside the loop; inside the loop it would be more like the combination of two such exponentials, one from each end.

The total twist can be shared between the loop and the space outside it, just as it is in the belt.  And in principle its internal-external ratio could be different in the muon than the electron.  But we already know that the muon has the same external field as the electron; otherwise we would not measure it as having the same charge (this is another empirical result that would ultimately have to be explained, but we will not pursue it further here).  Hence it should have the same total twist outside the loop, and so the internal should be the same as well.  Only now the internal twist is shared among three loops.
<p>

	Now, we have said that the three loops were formed with alternating sense, such that their “net turn” is 360 degrees.  That is what determines the total twist in the first place.  But the twist of the resulting manifold need not be distributed to each loop according to its sense; it can be distributed in any manner, as long as its total remains invariant.  And apparently the most stable distribution would be for the total twist of the loops to spread evenly among them.  In that case, each loop will have one-third of the total twist of the electron loop.
<p>

	But since the external field is the same as that of the electron, and the loop is continuous with external space through the singularity, the internal fields of the two particles near the singularity should also look the same.  In particular, their pseudo-exponential accumulation of twist should have the same form.  However, the muon loop only needs to accumulate one-third as much as the electron.  The situation would then look something like this:
<p>

The muon loop is represented by the small red curve near the origin.  Although it appears almost linear, it is actually the same double-exponential as the electron, but with each end truncated so that it only obtains one-third of the value.  Hence the muon loop becomes much shorter than the electron loop.  As a result, its local twist rates never have the chance to decay significantly; the temporal twist thus has the same behavior, such that the frequency and in turn mass of the muon become much higher than the electron.
<p>

	The even shorter black curve is the tauon loop, with one fifth of the electron twist.  By the same reasoning, its mass will be higher than that of the muon.  On the other hand, based on the smooth decay profile above, it doesn’t seem that it would be nearly twenty times higher, as it is in reality.  In order to account for this, there might have to be a region of faster twist near the origin, at some point transitioning to a more gradual regime (see graph below).  If this high-twist central region accounted for, say, one sixth of the total, most of the tauon’s twist would occur inside it, so that the tauon would have a significantly shorter loop than the muon.  Furthermore, the fourth-generation lepton (“tau-prime”), with one-seventh of the electron twist per loop, would be entirely contained by this high-twist region.  That could explain why its mass would be much higher than expected, too high for us to detect it.  The justification for the high-twist region should have something to do with its proximity to the singularity.  But this aspect is of course extremely speculative.
<p>

<div class="figure-caption">
    If there were a high-twist region near the singularity, encompassing between one-seventh and one-fifth of the total, it could explain the high mass of the tauon and prohibitively high mass of the fourth-generation tau-prime, because the spin period is commensurate with the length of the spatial loop, indicated for each particle (not to scale).
</div>
</div>

An alternative could be that, as the spatial loop becomes shorter, nonlinear effects become more pronounced, and in particular, there is effectively a kind of force, almost a capillary effect, between the two ends of the loop that prevents the curvature from decaying as fully as it normally would.  As that effect becomes stronger, it makes the mass ratio between successive generations higher than otherwise expected.
<p>

	This concept has the potential to explain the mass difference between the up and down quarks as well.  If the loop segments are structured in a way similar to the diagram in "<a href="{{=URL('spacetime','index',vars={'section':'baryons'})}}">Baryon Charge</a>", then the turn of the down quark may occur over a length significantly shorter than that of the up quark.  Even though it has less charge overall, if its length is short enough, its twist rate will still be higher, giving it a greater mass.
