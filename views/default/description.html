PURPOSE
<p>
This is a website that is an aid for students learning physics.  It could
potentially be used for other subjects as well.  It is under the
GNU General Public License version 3.
<p><p>
CONCEPT
<p>
This site makes use of a directed labelled knowledge graph, where each vertex and
each edge contains a concept.  No two vertices contain the same concept, ie. each
vertex defines a new concept.  However, multiple edges can share the same concept.
<p>
Often, the vertex concepts will correspond to nouns - eg. body, mass, velocity,
surface, sum, product, integral, interval, etc.  Many edge concepts will correspond to
prepositions - thus, an edge with its two vertices will correspond to phrases such as:
<p>
    <div class="indented">
      mass OF body<br>
      interval FROM quantity<br>
      interval TO quantity<br>
      force ON body<br>
      force OF body<br>
      sum OF quantity
    </div>
<p>
The concept in a vertex can correspond to a general concept, like those mentioned above,
<i>or</i> a specific instance of a more general concept.  In the latter case, the vertex
will have an edge with the concept 'IS A' pointing to the general concept it instantiates.
For example:
<p>
    <div class="indented">
      force IS A vector<br>
      vector IS A quantity<br>
      'my force' IS A force
    </div>
<p>
Here 'my force' represents a specific force mentioned in a specific problem.
<p>
Each concept has an ID, description, synonyms, etc., so multiple concepts can have the same
name and we can still distinguish one from another.
<p>
In addition to the special 'IS A' concept which organizes concepts in terms of inheritance, there is
an 'IN' concept which organizes them into categories.  For example:
<p>
    <div class="indented">
      force IN Newtonian physics<br>
      Newtonian physics IN physics<br>
      vector IN mathematics<br>
      geometry IN mathematics
    </div>
<p>
When a student inputs a problem description, they choose one or more categories to place it
in.  A vertex is created for the problem, and it is categorized appropriately.
<p>
    <div class="indented">
        'problem 17' IN thermodynamics
    </div>
<p>
The concepts the student adds to the problem description are categorized
within the problem's vertex:
<p>
    <div class="indented">
      'my force' IN 'problem 17'<br>
      'my force' IS A force<br>
      'my body' IN 'problem 17'<br>
      'my body' IS A body
    </div>
<p>
Aside from the IN edges that group them into the same description, and the 'IS A' edges that
state what concepts they instantiate, the vertices in either a law or problem description have
edges between them to indicate the relations between them.  For example,
<p>
    <div class="indented">
      'my force' OF 'my body'<br>
      'my force' ON 'other body'<br>
      'my velocity' OF 'my body'<br>
      'my velocity' AT 'time 1'<br>
      'other velocity' OF 'other body'<br>
      'other velocity' AT 'time 2'
    </div>
<p>
Each general law, such as the law of conservation of energy, is also given its own vertex,
and each concept within its description is 'IN' it.
<p>
A general law also has one or more predicates - each predicate also receives a vertex, eg.
<p>
    <div class="indented">
        'predicate 1' OF 'Newton's 2nd Law'<br>
        'predicate 1' IS A predicate
    </div>
<p>
where 'predicate' and 'OF' are built-in meta-concepts.
<p>
The subgraph of the law that corresponds to the predicate is all marked as 'IN' the predicate.
But there is a key difference: the predicate does not consist of vertices, but rather <i>the edges between them</i>.
Remember, each vertex defines a unique concept; it is only the edges that share common concepts, so these are
what can be used to test whether the law applies to the problem.
<p>
Consequently, we have to allow edges to terminate on other edges, as well as vertices, so that we can have edges
marking each predicate edge as being 'IN' the predicate.  In practice we do this by storing both vertices and edges
under the general heading of 'parts'; a part can optionally have a 'start' and/or 'end', making it an edge, and these
fields can refer to any other part, whether edge or vertex.
<p>
Hence, just as classes and instances are represented by the same type of entity (a 'concept'), a general
law and a specific case are each represented by a simple directed graph.  If we use the 'IN' edges to properly
categorize each new concept or relation, the entire knowledge graph will remain a single connected entity.
<p>
After a student builds a problem description, we need to find any general laws that can be applied to
it.  This means, first, finding a predicate that 'matches' the problem.  Since any predicate is itself a graph,
and the problem is a graph, a 'match' is really an isomorphism -- between the predicate, and any subgraph of the problem.
<p>
A key point here is that a predicate will include edges that extend to concepts <i>outside</i> its law.  Typically,
most of these will be 'IS A' links: for example, any law of physics that applies to a body is predicated first and foremost
on the existence of the body, hence the law contains a vertex which 'IS A body', and that 'IS A' link is part of the predicate.
Such 'external links' need not be 'IS A', though presumably most are.
<p>
Any problem that matches that predicate will therefore have a matching link <i>to the same external vertex</i>.  In this way
it becomes easy to check for matching predicates; we simply start from each of the problem's 'external vertices',
and try to build two matching subgraphs, one link at a time, extending one of them into any predicate that links to the same
external vertex, and the other into the problem graph.  We do this recursively so as to catch all possible ways the predicate
can be applied to the given problem.
<p>
In graph theory, this is known as the "subgraph isomorphism problem".  While this is a hard
problem in general, most of the laws and problems students are dealing with will have relatively small graphs,
and hence the algorithm can run in quite reasonable time.
<p>
If we find such an isomorphism from a given predicate, we can apply the associated law, by taking
all the structure of the law outside that predicate, and appending it to the problem graph, making
sure we don't append parts that are already there.  (To avoid this, we simply extend the matching algorithm,
allowing it to match edges outside the predicate, but not requiring them -- we only require that, for a vertex
outside the predicate to be included in the match, <i>all</i> of its edges to predicate vertices must be
matched.  Then, we only append structure that has not already been matched.)
<p>
We can do this iteratively in order to solve a problem.  Of course, the computer couldn't feasibly do this alone,
because the number of ways all possible laws could be applied would lead to combinatorial explosion.
But that is why this approach is perfectly suited as a learning aid: we want the student to explore the possible ways
of solving the problem, while the computer merely keeps track of the conceptual relationships, displays them in a
familiar way, and uses them to suggest possibilities.
<p>
REPRESENTATION
<p>
Although the graph is the core and should always remain accessible, we can build
additional interfaces that make building and solving a problem much more intuitive.  This is vital, as
a student should not have to learn complex graph syntax while they're trying to learn the subject
at hand.  Instead, each concept record can store rules in a simple programming language, used to
visualize it as a picture or symbol, using built-in primitive shapes and symbols.
This would provide a more intuitive drag-and-drop experience.
<p>
A sample visualization program could look like this:
<p>
    <div class="indented">
    Circle circle<br>
    circle.position.x = 250<br>
    circle.position.y = 100<br>
    circle.radius = 50
    </div>
<p>
Here the Circle type, with its "position" and "radius" members, is a built-in visual primitive that can be parsed and displayed
(in fact, any visual primitive has a 'position' member).
<p>
In general, though, the way that a particular vertex is visualized will depend not only on its concept, but its connectivity to
other parts in the graph.  In other words, the visualization program itself might have to identify predicates within the graph,
and change how it is drawn based on those predicates.  Since any such predicate should connect to the vertex in question, we can
use a path-based syntax to identify them.
<p>
For example, the 'body' concept might have this rule:
<p>
    <div class="indented">
    &lt;of&lt;*:x {<br>
    &emsp;x.position = position<br>
    }
    </div>
<p>
The first line is the predicate, which in this case is a single path.  Each path begins at the current part.  In this case we
look for a neighboring 'OF' edge that points to us, and whose other endpoint can be anything.  We label that endpoint 'x', and
set its position to our own.  This ensures that any property of a body will be drawn at the same pixel as the body itself.
<p>
The assignments to graph vertices are two-way.  That is, not only would the circle update itself according to the body's world
position, but if the user drags it to a new location, the 'coordinate' vertices would have their values updated accordingly.
<p>
There would be additional rules for resolving the values of vertices.  For example, the 'product' concept would say:
<p>
    <div class="indented">
    value = 1<br>
    &gt;of&gt;*:x {<br>
    &emsp;value *= x<br>
    }
    </div>
<p>
In other words, any product is 1 if nothing is being multiplied.  For each operand, which the product will point to via an 'OF'
edge, the product's value is multiplied by the operand value.  The operand isn't necessarily an instance of anything in particular,
so we simply match it with the wildcard '*'.  Note that the graph shorthand retrieves the 'value' of the referenced
vertex by default, so we don't have to include that.
<p>
In this way, each 'representation command' in one graph part that references another part, creates a dependency between them.  Whenever
we need to visualize the problem, write it symbolically (eg. as equations), or calculate the values of its members, we iterate through
the graph, resolving any commands that have no waiting dependencies, and as we resolve them, their values propagate to the commands that
were waiting on them, cascading on until all possible commands have been run.  Thus we resolve the graph into more familiar representations.
<p>
All value/representation rules of a given concept would be inherited by concepts that instantiate it via an 'IS A' edge, and these
'child concepts' could add to it or override any part of it.  For example, the 'force' concept, which 'IS A vector', might say
<p>
    <div class="indented">
    arrow.color = '#fb6'
    </div>
<p>
thus modifying the 'arrow' field that was defined in 'vector' to specify that forces will be represented by arrows of a specific color.
<p>
The representation language is fleshed out as we consider more involved examples.  Consider the addition of vectors: each
vector is visualized as an arrow, while their sum is drawn by placing the arrows head-to-tail in sequence, and the resultant is drawn
from the starting point to the ending point of our path.  We can capture this in the 'sum' concept as follows:

<div class="indented">
    &gt;of&gt;vector:v {<br>
    &emsp;1: Arrow resultant<br>
    &emsp;Arrow arrow<br>
    &emsp;arrow.position = resultant.components<br>
    &emsp;arrow.components = v.arrow.components<br>
    &emsp;resultant.components += arrow.components<br>
    }
</div>

<p>
Note that the predicate path '&gt;of&gt;vector:v', like any other predicate, is applied to all matching instances.  Thus it is effectively a loop
over all vector operands of the sum.  The '1:' prefix on the first command denotes that 'resultant' is only initialized for the first instance,
ie. once we know we have a sum of vectors.  After that, for each new operand, we create a vector, set its start point to the current
endpoint of the resultant, and its 'components' (a built-in field of the Arrow primitive) to those of the operand itself.
<p>
This program sequentially builds the visual model of a vector sum.  On the other hand, as the instances of the predicate have no true order,
we might worry that the order of parts (arrows) in the visual could suddenly be changed on refresh.  Furthermore, if every mouse
event (eg. dragging the endpoint of an arrow) triggers a refresh, we would prefer not to re-execute the whole visualization each time.  To avoid
both of these issues, we have each command store the commands that sequentially used or edited its output value.  These are identified during the initial
visualization, ie. they represent the de facto sequence, which is not inherent in the graph.  When a field is modified by user input, we
only need to re-run the commands that directly depend on it and their dependent sequences.
<p>
Note also that a command in general runs implicitly on sub-fields.  For example, in the line 'arrow.position = resultant.components', both 'position'
and 'components' actually have 'x' and 'y' sub-fields, so it is equivalent to the pair 'arrow.position.x = resultant.components.x; arrow.position.y = result.components.y'.
If one of the operand fields has no sub-fields, it is treated as a constant over all these sub-commands.
<p>
A predicate can be more than a single path; we just decompose it into paths so it can be expressed as text.  The components of a multi-path predicate can be
concatenated with the '&' sign.  For example, a 'coordinate system' can determine where 'points' in its domain are drawn.  Take the Cartesian coordinate system,
which has the following rule (here 'wrt' is short for 'with respect to').

<div class="indented">
    &lt;of&lt;x_axis&lt;wrt&lt;coordinate:x&gt;of&gt;point:p <br>
    & &lt;of&lt;y_axis&lt;wrt&lt;coordinate:y&gt;of&gt;p {<br>
    &emsp;p.position.x = x<br>
    &emsp;p.position.y = y<br>
    }
</div>

<p>
Notice that the variable <i>p</i> is re-used in the second path of the predicate, implying that the two paths terminate on the same 'point' vertex.  Other
coordinate systems would have the same rule, only with different axis names and coordinate-to-screen transformations.
<p>
There may be additional features of the representation language, to be worked out as the project is developed.  One question is the priority of commands,
when multiple commands from different parts would edit the same field.  For example, 'body' might contain a default command that ensures all of its properties
are drawn on top of it:

<div class="indented">
    &lt;of&lt;*:x {<br>
    &emsp;x.position = this.position<br>
    }
</div>

<p>
But some properties that are nominally 'OF' a body should not be drawn with that body as their origin.  For example, a 'position' (the physics concept, not the
built-in property of drawables) is 'OF' a body and 'WITH RESPECT TO' a 'coordinate system', and it is the latter that should determine the origin of the
displayed arrow.  So 'position' has this rule:

<div class="indented">
    &gt;with_respect_to&gt;coordinate_system:c {<br>
    &emsp;this.position = c.position<br>
    }
</div>

<p>
The question is, since rules from different parts are executed in arbitrary order, how do we ensure the priority of the second command?  Probably the most natural
rule is that a command which edits a field of its own part should take precedence over commands from other parts.  But there may be exceptions, and we might have
to implement importance keywords akin to CSS, thus giving the content writers the necessary flexibility.
